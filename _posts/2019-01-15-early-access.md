![Project Zuru Home]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/unknown (1).png)


It all began around 2013 with Project ArchPlan 3D, developed by Carianni brothers, which count a dozen years as BIM users as designers of architetural projects of any kind, they saw that things could be done differently, BIM apps were too complex for a casual user to work on...they wanted to change that once and forever and finally give everyone the chance to create a building from scratch with ease.

Project Zuru Home is not only a BIM app, is the first community-driven holistic multiplayer design framework!

We are really excited to start sharing all this with the world...we can't wait to see what you are going to do with Dreamcatcher!

### Dreamcatcher Community-driven Early Access

So, now after many years of development and the relentlessly efforts of our team here in Modena, India and China, we're finally ready to release an early access version of our app.

Dreamcather is a fully-fledged BIM and Early Access v0.8 will be codenamed "Hyena", as a famelic but yet powerful version of our app!

We could summarize all the features and details of this release here, but we'll leave that for our new website which is in the making! 

We can just anticipate that's going to be a fully fledged BIM built inside the marvelous real-time graphics of Unreal Engine 4 with 3D editing of walls, doors, windows, slabs, stairs, a 3D modeling free-shape design tool, artificial intelligence architect (what!? shhh..that's a spolier!)...ok can't say anymore for now, stay tuned for moar! 

### When is the clsoed Early Access going to be released?

We're going to launch between March and April, many different versions with different audiences will be released.

### Do I have a chance to partecipate in the closed Early Access release?

Sure! We'll update our website with the registration web 3D game (what's that?! A 3D game for registering into the closed release? Stay tuned...it's going to be fun) :D

### Requirements minimum specs, multi-platform releases, features, supported formats, other questions

We know that you still don't know anything about Project Home...but fear not, a new website is coming, packed with detailed description of everything. 

Stay tuned!
