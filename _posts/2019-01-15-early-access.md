We are really excited to announce that after more than 5 years of R&D (the project's grassroots set us back to 2013 when me, Martin and my brother Alessio started a project called ArchPlan 3D and then in 2016 when we joined forces with Zuru) we're finally here, getting everything ready for you to try Zuru Home, a complete redefinition of how to build, design, collaborate and visualize architecture!

Project Zuru Home is not only a BIM app, is the first community-driven holistic multiplayer design framework!

We want to give everyone the chance to create a building from scratch with ease, from design to construction, a real revolution. This early access aims to share with you the first stage of the project: our design platform!

We are really excited to start sharing all this with the world...we can't wait to see what you are going to do with Zuru Home!

#### Zuru Home Community-driven Early Access

So, now after many years of development and the relentlessly efforts of our team here in Modena, India and China, we're finally ready to release an early access version of our app.

Zuru Home is a fully-fledged BIM and Early Access v0.8 will be codenamed "Hyena", as a famelic but yet powerful version of our app!

We could summarize all the features and details of this release here, but we'll leave that for our new website which is in the making! 

We can just anticipate that's going to be a fully fledged BIM built inside the marvelous real-time graphics of Unreal Engine 4 with 3D editing of walls, doors, windows, slabs, stairs, a 3D modeling free-shape design tool, artificial intelligence architect (what!? shhh..that's a spolier!)...ok can't say anymore for now, stay tuned for more! 

#### When is the closed Early Access going to be released?

We're going to launch between March and April, many different versions with different audiences will be released.

#### Can I partecipate in the closed Early Access release?

Sure! We'll update our website with the registration web 3D game (what's that?! A 3D game for registering into the closed release? Stay tuned...it's going to be fun) :D

#### Minimum specs, multi-platform releases, other questions

We know that you still don't know anything about Project Home...but fear not, a new website is coming, packed with detailed description of everything. 

Stay tuned!
